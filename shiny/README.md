### Overview
This tool allows users to estimate the power of their sequencing experiments for CNV detection. The formulae used for power calculations are described in: link to biorxiv paper

### Parameters specified by user
L : hypothesized length of CNV  
D : haploid read depth of experiment  
N : hypothesized ploidy of CNV  
l : read length in sequencing experiment  
W : window size in bases  
F : tumor purity [range 0-1]  
$\theta $ : variance inflation factor of experiment
