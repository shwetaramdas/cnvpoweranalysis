### Overview
This tool allows users to estimate the power of their sequencing experiments for CNV detection.  
The formulae used for power calculations are described in: "SS"  
If you find this tool useful, please consider cite our paper.  

### Parameters specified by user
F: the portion of the sample that contains the CNA or CNV  
alpha: the significance level  
L: the length of the CNA or CNV  
N: the ploidy of the CNA or CNV (normal diploid regions have N=2)  
W: the size of the window  
l: average sequencing read length  
D: haploid sequencing depth (for a diploid dataset of 30X total coverage, the haploid coverage is 15)  
theta: the variance inflation factor, equal to phi*N*D*W/l  
phi: the variance inflation factor
